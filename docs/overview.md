## Project Overview

The AI-Driven Penetration Testing Framework is designed to automate and enhance security testing processes by leveraging artificial intelligence capabilities. The system follows a multi-agent architecture where specialized agents collaborate to perform reconnaissance, vulnerability discovery, and reporting tasks.

Key features include:
- Multi-agent cooperation protocol (MCP) server for orchestration
- Vector database for semantic search of security patterns
- Integration with Claude LLM for reasoning and analysis
- Real-time task monitoring and notification system
- Knowledge integration for context-aware security assessments

## Architecture

The system architecture consists of the following main components:

1. **MCP Server**: Central orchestration layer that manages task distribution, agent communication, and system state
2. **Agent Framework**: Modular system for creating specialized agents that can perform security testing tasks
3. **Knowledge Base**: Vector database containing security patterns, vulnerabilities, and service fingerprints
4. **Task Management System**: Queue-based task distribution and status tracking
5. **WebSocket Notification System**: Real-time updates for monitoring task progress

## Core Components

### Task Management System

The task management system handles the creation, distribution, tracking, and completion of security testing tasks throughout the system.

**Key Features:**
- **Task Queuing**: Tasks are organized into type-specific queues (reconnaissance, vulnerability discovery, etc.)

- **Result Storage**: Persistent storage of task results for future reference and analysis

**Implementation:**
- Redis-backed task queues for reliable persistence and pub/sub capabilities
- JSON-based task data format for flexibility
- Progress percentage tracking for granular status monitoring
- Atomic task operations to prevent race conditions

- Service fingerprints (for service identification)
- Exploits and mitigations (for remediation)

### Real-Time Notification System

The real-time notification system enables immediate updates on task status changes, agent activities, and security findings for monitoring and coordination.

**Key Features:**

task_data = {
    "type": "reconnaissance",
    "target": "192.168.1.1",
    "scope": {
        "ip_range": "192.168.1.0/24",
        "excluded_ips": [],
        "excluded_ports": [],
        "max_depth": 2
    },
    "description": "Perform initial reconnaissance of target network",
    "priority": 2
}

response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8000/api/task/create",
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer dev_token"},
    json=task_data
)

task_id = response.json()["task_id"]
print(f"Created task with ID: {task_id}")
```

### Running a Reconnaissance Agent

```bash
python src/utils/run_agent.py --type reconnaissance
```

### Querying the Knowledge Base

```python
# Query vulnerabilities for a service
kb = SecurityKnowledgeBase()
results = kb.query_vulnerabilities(
    query_text="Apache 2.4.41 vulnerability",
    affected_service="Apache HTTP Server"
)

# Process and display results
for i, doc in enumerate(results["documents"][0]):
    print(f"Vulnerability: {results['metadatas'][0][i]['name']}")
    print(f"Description: {doc[:200]}...")
    print(f"CVE: {results['metadatas'][0][i]['cve_id']}")
    print(f"CVSS Score: {results['metadatas'][0][i]['cvss_score']}")
```

### Monitoring Task Progress via WebSocket

```javascript
// Browser-side WebSocket client
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8000/ws/task-updates');

ws.onmessage = function(event) {
    const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
    console.log(`Task ${data.task_id} status: ${data.status}`);
    console.log(`Progress: ${data.progress}%`);
    console.log(`Message: ${data.message}`);
    
    // Update UI based on task status
    updateTaskProgressBar(data.task_id, data.progress);
};

## Limitations and Future Work

### Current Limitations
