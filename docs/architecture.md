# Architecture

The AI-Driven Penetration Testing Framework follows a multi-agent architecture designed around a central orchestration server. This document explains the overall architecture and the interaction between components.

## Architecture Overview

![Architecture Diagram](architecture_diagram.svg)

The system is designed with the following key architectural components:

1. **MCP (Multi-agent Cooperation Protocol) Server**: The central orchestration layer
2. **Agent Framework**: Specialized agents for security testing tasks
3. **Knowledge Base**: Vector database for security intelligence
4. **Task Management System**: Distributes and tracks tasks across agents
5. **WebSocket Notification System**: Provides real-time updates on system activity

## Component Interactions

The diagram below illustrates how these components interact:

1. The MCP Server orchestrates the overall workflow
2. Agents register with the MCP Server and receive tasks
3. The Knowledge Base provides security intelligence to agents
4. The Task Management System tracks progress and dependencies
5. The WebSocket Notification System provides real-time updates

## Data Flow

1. **Task Creation**:
   - User creates a task or workflow via the API
   - MCP Server validates and stores the task
   - Task is added to the appropriate queue

2. **Task Processing**:
   - Agent polls for tasks matching its capabilities
   - Agent updates task status as it progresses
   - Agent queries knowledge base for contextual information
   - Agent stores results upon completion

3. **Workflow Orchestration**:
   - Workflow orchestrator monitors task completion
   - When a task completes, dependent tasks are created
   - Entire workflow status is tracked until completion

4. **Result Reporting**:
   - Results from all tasks are aggregated
   - Report generator creates formatted output
   - User receives notification of completion

## Technical Architecture

The system uses a modern, asynchronous architecture:

- **FastAPI** provides the web framework and API endpoints
- **Redis** serves as the message broker and task queue
- **ChromaDB** provides vector search capabilities
- **WebSockets** enable real-time communication
- **Docker** containerizes all components for easy deployment

## Scalability Considerations

The architecture is designed to scale horizontally:

- Agents can be deployed across multiple machines
- Redis allows for distributed task management
- The MCP Server can be load-balanced for higher throughput
- Task queues provide natural buffering during high loads

## Security Considerations

- All communication between components is authenticated
- Scope restrictions are enforced at the MCP Server level
- Tool execution is isolated through containerization
- Human approval is required for high-risk operations
